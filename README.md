## üåü Vision: Beyond Calculation, Towards Intuition

Standard computation excels at predefined algorithms. **Project Ramanujan (InfinityQ)** aims for a deeper level of AI cognition: mathematical *intuition*. We draw inspiration from Srinivasa Ramanujan's uncanny ability to perceive profound mathematical patterns and from the elegant, efficient techniques of Vedic Mathematics.

This project focuses on developing an AI that can:

1.  **Deeply Understand:** Move beyond surface syntax to grasp the core concepts of a mathematical problem.
2.  **Recognize Patterns:** Actively identify underlying structures, problem archetypes, and applicable mathematical motifs.
3.  **Strategize Effectively:** Evaluate diverse solution paths, weighing their suitability and potential efficiency.
4.  **Seek Elegance:** Prioritize concise, insightful methods reminiscent of Ramanujan's findings and Vedic sutras.
5.  **Verify Rigorously:** Employ multi-stage verification, including cross-checking with different approaches, to ensure accuracy.

This is an **open-source initiative** calling for collaboration among AI researchers, mathematicians, software developers, and anyone excited by the fusion of artificial intelligence and advanced mathematical reasoning.

## üß¨ Methodology: The InfinityQ Iterative Reasoning & Verification Cycle

Central to Project Ramanujan is a unique, multi-stage dialogue designed to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) like **Gemma 3** towards rigorous and insightful solutions. This **Iterative Reasoning & Verification Cycle** breaks down problem-solving into distinct, prompted phases:

**Phase 1: Structured Reasoning & Strategy (5 Steps)**

The AI is guided through a sequential analysis:

1.  **`STEP 1: ANALYZE PROBLEM (Givens, Goal, Type)`**
    *   **Objective:** Extract all explicit/implicit information. Define the target objective. Classify the mathematical domain (Algebra, Number Theory, Geometry, etc.).
2.  **`STEP 2: IDENTIFY SOLUTION PATTERNS`**
    *   **Objective:** Brainstorm potential recurring structures, known problem forms, or mathematical patterns applicable to this specific problem. Go beyond standard textbook methods.
3.  **`STEP 3: LIST TECHNIQUES (Theorems, Vedic Maths)`**
    *   **Objective:** Enumerate relevant mathematical theorems, standard techniques, formulas, and potentially applicable **Vedic Maths** sutras or shortcuts relevant to the problem type and identified patterns. Build context brick-by-brick.
4.  **`STEP 4: ASSESS TECHNIQUE SUITABILITY`**
    *   **Objective:** Evaluate the listed techniques. Estimate the likelihood ('probability') that each approach will lead to an efficient and correct solution based on the problem's characteristics.
5.  **`STEP 5: EXECUTE BEST-FIT TECHNIQUE (Brick-by-Brick)`**
    *   **Objective:** Select the technique deemed most suitable in Step 4. Apply the method systematically, showing clear, logical steps. Prioritize conciseness and leverage Vedic Maths insights where appropriate.

**Phase 2: Initial Solution Verification (Step 6)**

6.  **`STEP 6: PRELIMINARY VALIDATION`**
    *   **Objective:** Before accepting the result from Step 5, perform an initial sanity check. Does the logic flow correctly? Are all mathematical rules and constraints respected? Does the result seem plausible?

**Phase 3: Multi-Approach Cross-Verification**

*   **`RE-SOLVE & VERIFY x3 (Diverse Approaches)`**
    *   **Objective:** Generate the final answer **three separate times**. For each attempt, *force the use of a different valid technique* identified earlier (if possible). This acts as a powerful cross-check against method-specific errors.
*   **`CONVERGENCE CHECK (Mode Calculation)`**
    *   **Objective:** Compare the three answers. The proposed final answer is the **mode** (most frequent result). Significant divergence indicates high uncertainty or errors in one or more approaches.

**Phase 4: Final Detailed Audit**

*   **`FINAL RIGOROUS CHECK`**
    *   **Objective:** Take the modal answer. Conduct one last, meticulous verification pass, tracing the logic of the primary method that produced the modal answer. Ensure perfect alignment with all relevant formulas, rules, and mathematical principles.

**Guiding Principles (Embedded in Prompts):**

*   **Efficiency & Insight:** Explicitly request summarized forms, clever tricks, Vedic Maths, and "thinking like Srinivasa Ramanujan."
*   **Output Constraint:** Mandate the final answer as an integer **modulo 1000**.
*   **Pattern-Centricity:** The methodology inherently steers the AI towards pattern recognition (Step 2) and strategic assessment (Step 4) over brute force.

**Training Philosophy:** Future fine-tuning will emphasize **understanding over memorization**. We aim to train models on the *diversity of solution patterns*, the elegance of proofs, common pitfalls, and the strategic application of techniques (including Vedic Maths), rather than sheer volume of question-answer pairs.
