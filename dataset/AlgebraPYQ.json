            "question": "Q1. Professor Oak is feeding his 100 Pokémon. Each Pokémon has a bowl whose capacity is a positive real number of kilograms. These capacities are known to Professor Oak. The total capacity of all the bowls is 100 kilograms. Professor Oak distributes 100 kilograms of food in such a way that each Pokémon receives a non-negative integer number of kilograms of food (which may be larger than the capacity of their bowl). The dissatisfaction level of a Pokémon who received N kilograms of food and whose bowl has a capacity of C kilograms is equal to |N - C|. Find the smallest real number D such that, regardless of the capacities of the bowls, Professor Oak can distribute the food in a way that the sum of the dissatisfaction levels over all the 100 Pokémon is at most D.",
            "answer": "50",
            "solution": "First, consider a case where 99 bowls have a capacity of 0.5 kg and one bowl has a capacity of 50.5 kg, summing to 100 kg. If Professor Oak gives 0 kg to the 99 Pokémon and 100 kg to the last, the dissatisfaction is 99 × 0.5 + |100 - 50.5| = 49.5 + 49.5 = 99 > 50. However, giving 1 kg to each of the 99 Pokémon and 1 kg to the last yields a dissatisfaction of 99 × |1 - 0.5| + |1 - 50.5| = 99 × 0.5 + 49.5 = 99, still > 50. The minimum dissatisfaction here is 50, achieved by giving 0 kg to all, adjusting as needed, suggesting D ≥ 50.\n\nNow, for any set of capacities C_i summing to 100, let F_i = C_i - ⌊C_i⌋ be the fractional parts, ordered F_1 ≤ ... ≤ F_100. Give each Pokémon ⌊C_i⌋ kg initially, leaving R = 100 - Σ⌊C_i⌋ = ΣF_i kg. Distribute this R kg as 1 kg extra to the R Pokémon with the largest F_i. The dissatisfaction is d = Σ_{i=1}^{100-R} F_i + Σ_{i=100-R+1}^{100} (1 - F_i) = 2Σ_{i=1}^{100-R} F_i. Since F_i ≤ 1, and their average is R/100, d ≤ 2(100 - R) × (R/100) ≤ 50 by AM-GM. Thus, D = 50 is achievable and minimal."

            "answer": null,
            "solution": "Substitute s = x + y and t = x - y, so x = (s + t)/2, y = (s - t)/2. The inequality becomes f(s) f(t) ≥ f((s + t)/2)^2 - f((s - t)/2)^2. Replacing t with -t gives f(s) f(-t) ≥ f((s - t)/2)^2 - f((s + t)/2)^2. Adding these, we get f(s) [f(t) + f(-t)] ≥ 0 for all s, t. Since the original inequality is strict for some x_0, y_0, let t_0 = x_0 - y_0, making it strict for s = x_0 + y_0, t = t_0, so f(t_0) + f(-t_0) ≠ 0. Thus, f(s) has a constant sign, as f(s) [f(t_0) + f(-t_0)] ≥ 0 holds for all s, and the strictness ensures consistency across all real numbers."

Since f > 0, y - f^{2m}(y) < y, so m(y - f^2(y)) < y, implying f^2(y) = y. Thus, x f(x) ≥ y f(y), so x f(x) = c > 0, hence f(x) = c/x.
